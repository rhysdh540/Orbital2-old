(it doesn't use lwjgl)

resources:
 - [desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/icaqw49qeq) (sorta)
 - [physics tutorials](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/game/mastersdegree/gametechnologies/physicstutorials/)

todo:
 - [ ] do collisions correctly so that we follow the laws of physics
 - [ ] integrate physics rather than simulating it on specific time steps
 - [ ] add more bodies
 - [ ] add more shapes?
